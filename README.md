 Data visualization and BI tools are essential for any modern organization to make
 fast, data-driven decisions. With a wide range of visualization tools available to
 choose from, it’s important to know what makes each platform unique. Most BI
 platforms allows to create data visualizations, perform complicated data analysis, and
 build interactive dashboards, open source BI tools offer even more benefits. Whether
 you’re looking for cost effectiveness, customizability, wide-spread community support,
 enhanced security, or future-proofing features, open source BI is the way to go.
 Apache Superset and Metabase are the two popular open-source business intelligence
 platforms.
 The objective of this project is to evaluate and compare two popular open-source
 business intelligence (BI) tools, Apache Superset and Metabase, by creating parallel,
 fully functional dashboards using the same dataset. These will demonstrate the
 features and capabilities of each tool, allowing for a comprehensive comparison based
 on visualizations, user interactions, ease of use, and advanced functionalities.
